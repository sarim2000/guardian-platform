## 4. Product Scope & Features

The Guardian Platform will be developed in phases, starting with a foundational MVP and iteratively adding more sophisticated capabilities.

### 4.1. Phase 1: MVP - Git-Powered Service Catalog & Extensible Foundation

* **Goal:** Establish a robust, extensible, and accurate Service Catalog by integrating with a Git provider and ingesting service metadata from `guardian-manifest.yaml` files.
* **Key Features:**
    1.  **Configurable Git Provider Integration (Backend):**
        * Support for one primary Git provider (e.g., GitHub) via system-level PAT.
        * Admin-configurable target Git organization.
        * Backend designed with an adapter pattern for future extensibility to other Git providers.
    2.  **`guardian-manifest.yaml` Definition & Processing:**
        * A defined YAML schema (`apiVersion: guardian.io/v1alpha1`, `kind: Service`, `metadata`, `spec` including `owner`, `lifecycle`, `tier`, `links`, `defaultChecklistTemplateId`, `techStack`).
        * Backend logic to parse and validate these manifest files found in repositories.
    3.  **Repository Data Ingestion & Storage (Backend & Database):**
        * Manual trigger for a backend process to scan Git repositories, find `guardian-manifest.yaml` files, parse them, and store structured data in PostgreSQL.
        * Idempotent upsert logic for service data.
        * Storage of key parsed fields and raw manifest data (JSONB).
    4.  **Service Catalog API (Backend):**
        * Well-defined RESTful API endpoints:
            * `POST /api/catalog/ingestion/trigger`: To initiate the Git sync and manifest ingestion.
            * `GET /api/services`: To list services with pagination, filtering, and sorting.
            * `GET /api/services/{id}`: To retrieve detailed information for a single service.
            * (Minimal) `PATCH /api/services/{id}`: For any Guardian-specific overrides (if any in MVP).
    5.  **Basic Service Catalog UI (Frontend):**
        * Admin interface to trigger catalog ingestion.
        * Service list page displaying key information from manifests (name, owner, lifecycle, etc.) with filtering and sorting.
        * Service detail page showing all ingested manifest data, including clickable links.
        * Built with reusable UI components and a clean, intuitive design.

### 4.2. Phase 2: Core Readiness & Release Execution (Building on MVP)

* **Goal:** Enable teams to manage and execute standardized readiness checklists for services listed in the catalog.
* **Key Features:**
    1.  **Standardized Checklist Templates:**
        * UI for administrators/platform teams to design, create, version, and manage reusable checklist templates.
        * Templates to include categories, tasks, descriptions, guidance, and potentially default priorities or assignees (roles).
        * Ability to clone and customize templates.
    2.  **Release-Specific Checklists:**
        * Ability to instantiate checklists from templates for a specific service (from the catalog) and a specific release (e.g., release version/identifier, target date).
        * Association of `defaultChecklistTemplateId` from `guardian-manifest.yaml` to streamline instantiation.
    3.  **Granular Task Tracking:**
        * Monitor individual task progress with detailed statuses (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done, N/A, Blocked, Needs Review).
        * Assign tasks to individuals or teams.
        * Set due dates and priorities for tasks.
    4.  **Evidence & Contextual Discussions:**
        * Ability to attach evidence of task completion (links to documents, PRs, test results, etc.).
        * Threaded discussions directly on tasks for collaboration and clarification.
    5.  **Clear Ownership & Assignments:**
        * Explicitly define and display owners for services (from manifest) and assignees for tasks.
    6.  **(Advanced for Phase 2) Configurable Approval Workflows:**
        * Implement simple review and approval gates for checklist completion or critical tasks.
    7.  **(Advanced for Phase 2) Task Dependency Management:**
        * Define and visualize simple "blocks/blocked by" dependencies between tasks within a checklist.

### 4.3. Future Phases (High-Level Vision)

* **Phase 3: Proactive Communication & Visibility:**
    * Multi-channel notification system (in-app, email, Slack/Teams) for assignments, status changes, blockers, reminders.
    * Personalized and role-based dashboards ("My Tasks," team progress, admin overview).
    * Advanced search, filtering, and sorting across all entities.
    * Comprehensive audit trails for accountability and compliance.
* **Phase 4: Reporting & Process Insights:**
    * Readiness analytics (completion rates, timelines, overdue items, common blockers).
    * Trend analysis to identify patterns, problematic areas, and process bottlenecks over time.
* **Phase 5: AI-Powered Assistance & Optimization (Iterative Rollout):**
    * Contextual Knowledge Assistant (RAG Q&A against internal documentation linked via manifests).
    * Intelligent Task Suggestion for checklist templates based on service attributes.
    * Proactive Risk Flagging in active checklists.
    * Smart Assignee Recommendations.
    * Checklist Effectiveness Analysis (correlating adherence with post-release outcomes).
