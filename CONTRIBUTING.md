## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional components in React

### Code Style

```typescript
// Good
export const fetchServices = async (teamId: string): Promise<Service[]> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/services?team=${teamId}`);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch services: ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  return response.json();
};

// Avoid
export async function fetch_services(team_id) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/services?team=' + team_id);
  return res.json();
}
```

### Database

- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Create migrations for schema changes
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Index frequently queried columns

### React Components

- Use function components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Use Mantine UI components
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

```typescript
describe('Service Discovery', () => {
  it('should parse valid service YAML', () => {
    const yaml = `
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: test-service
    `;
    const result = parseServiceYaml(yaml);
    expect(result.metadata.name).toBe('test-service');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Mock external services
- Use test database

### E2E Tests
