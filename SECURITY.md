## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Report Via Email

Send details to: security@guardian-platform.com

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: 30-90 days depending on severity

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong encryption keys (32+ characters)
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use least-privilege AWS IAM policies

2. **GitHub App**
   - Limit repository access
   - Use minimal required permissions
   - Rotate private keys periodically
   - Monitor app activity

3. **AWS Credentials**
   - Use read-only IAM roles
   - Enable MFA where possible
   - Monitor CloudTrail logs
   - Use temporary credentials

4. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable SSL/TLS connections
   - Restrict network access
   - Regular backups with encryption

### For Contributors

1. **Code Security**
   - Never hardcode secrets
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Authentication**
   - Use secure session management
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Log security events
   - Use HTTPS everywhere

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

1. **Encryption**
   - AWS credentials encrypted with AES-256
   - Secure key storage
   - Encrypted database connections

2. **Access Control**
   - Organization-level authentication
   - Role-based permissions
   - API authentication

3. **Audit Logging**
   - User action tracking
   - Resource access logs
   - Security event monitoring

### Recommended Additional Security

1. **Network Security**
   - Use VPN/private networks
   - Implement firewall rules
   - Enable DDoS protection

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up security alerts
   - Monitor unusual activity
   - Regular security audits

3. **Compliance**
   - Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Implement CSP headers
   - Regular penetration testing

## Security Checklist

### Deployment

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificates
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] API rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Logging and monitoring active

### Development

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Service Discovery**
   - YAML files are parsed securely
   - Repository access is read-only
   - No code execution from YAML

2. **Chat Feature**
   - LLM inputs are sanitized
   - No direct system access
   - Response content filtered

3. **AWS Discovery**
   - Read-only access enforced
   - Credentials encrypted at rest
   - Limited to specified regions

## Security Updates

Security patches are released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate hotfix
- **High**: Within 7 days
- **Medium**: Within 30 days
- **Low**: Next regular release
